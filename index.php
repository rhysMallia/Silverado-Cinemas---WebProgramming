						A Global Standard	
						</li>
						<article>
							Every DVD worldwide and all HD broadcasts in the United States use Dolby Digital 
							(also known as AC-3). Dolby Digital 5.1 has evolved into Dolby Digital Plus, delivering up to 7.1 channels of surround sound in devices ranging from TVs to mobile phones.

							5.1 Multichannel Sound
						</li>
						<article>
							With 5.1 channels of high-quality audio, Dolby Digital places you in the center of the action. It expands the left and right traditional stereo channels to deliver an enveloping 360 degrees of sound.

							Effcient Sound
						</li>
						<article>
							At its core, Dolby Digital technology represents a very efficient way for movie studios, television networks, and other content providers to compress the size of multichannel audio files without impairing the sound quality. The smaller the file, the easier it is to distribute. With Dolby Digital, it's possible to include a full 5.1 channel audio mix on a film print or a DVD, or as part of a TV broadcast. This expands the creative palette for artists, and allows those of us in the audience to experience greater realism and excitement.
